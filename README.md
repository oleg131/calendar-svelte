# [Demo](https://calendar.orchardroad.space/)

Simple calendar app to track day events (days you worked out, days you took your medicine etc.)

Click on the day to mark or unmark it.

Data is stored in `localStorage`.

You can keep different calendars by assigning `c` or `calendar` url parameter to some value, e.g.
`/?c=gym`.
